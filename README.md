# MoviesManiac

This is a website built using React Js + Vite configuration. This website will display a list of films from the themoviedb public API (https://www.themoviedb.org/). There are 3 categories of films based on 3 types of ending points. Namely popular films, top ratings and also upcoming films. This project consists of several features, including:

- call public API : to get list of movies
- sort and filter: to sort or/and filter films
- dark/light mode: to change the website theme
- local storage: to store several variables

and I also apply clean code principles as best as possible.
